## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check **Actions** tab for error details
2. Ensure you've enabled GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" source

### Camera Not Working
- PWA must be served over HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)

- Some browsers require user interaction before camera access

### PWA Not Installing
- Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS
- Try different browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Clear browser cache and try again
